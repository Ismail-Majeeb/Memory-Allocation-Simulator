# Memory-Allocation-Simulator
This is a simple application that simulates how to allocate a variable-sized partitions of the memory to a given sequence of processes requests while applying different allocation policies:

**1. First-Fit policy.**

**2. Best-Fit policy.**

**3. Worst-Fit policy.**

The program also has **_Compaction_** (as option for the user): **in compaction you shuffle the memory contents so as to place all free memory together in one large block**.
